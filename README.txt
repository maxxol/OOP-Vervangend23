OOP-substitute23

This repository contains the substitute project for OOP period 2.1 of NHL-Stenden

how to run:
-clone this repo
-run the Main class in your java IDE (src\nhlstenden\oopsubstitute23\main)

how to use:
you can add extra Property objects to the tax calculation by constructing them in the object\ObjectCreator class.
(remember to add the newly created object to the Array at the bottom of the method)
for best results keep Boats and houses separated.(this will prevent unnecessary whitespace)

if you want to use longer owner names and bigger values, it is possible the window won't fit them horizontally.
this can be fixed by adjusting the setSize method called on line 22 of ui\GUIWindow. (default is 600)

notes:
-earlier commits mention a Book class, this was confusion on my end and was replaced with the House class.

-this is a project to show basic affinity with the concept of OOP.
Some implemented aspects will either have no use or are a suboptimal way of tackling a problem.
